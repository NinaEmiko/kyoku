## About Kyoku

Kyoku is designed with musicians and audio engineers in mind. We want to give users the ability to toggle back and forth between multiple mixes of a song seamlessly. Whether you want to hear the difference between an unmixed version and a mixed version of a song, or you need help deciding between two different mixes, Kyoku allows you to upload the various versions of a track, and play them back easily from your phone. This enables you to listen to each mix on multiple sound sources (for example: in the car, on a home stereo set up, etc.) without having to lug around a laptop or desktop, burn different mixes to blank CD's, or upload different versions of the same songs to sites like SoundCloud, which do not enable you to toggle between multiple mixes to really compare the subtle nuances.
